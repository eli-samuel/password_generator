# password_generator
Password generator for Comp 232 Assignment 3. This program creates a password by concatenating 3 random words taken from a few pages in the book "Alice in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll. The program chooses 3 words randomly, checks them for newline and/or if they are only single character. Then, the program checks to see if the words are the same, if the length of the password is between 8 and 16 characters long, if the password contains and uppercase and lowercase character, and if the password contains one special (non-alphabetic) character. If any of these conditions are failed, the new words have to be chosen to make another password. If all these conditions are passed, the program then prints out the password along with the number of conditions which failed in the previous password generation attempts
